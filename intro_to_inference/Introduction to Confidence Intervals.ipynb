    "## Part 1: The Standard Deviation $\\sigma$ and the Standard Error $\\overline{SE}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Standard Deviation (SD for short) is one of the most important and popular topics in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's used all the time and the symbol statistician use to refer to it is the Greek letter sigma $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do we use the Standard Deviation $\\sigma$ for?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Standard Deviation, often represented by the lower case Greek letter sigma $\\sigma$, is a measure of how \"spread out\" or \"dispersed\" a set of data are.\n",
    "\n",
    "    NOTE: It is mathematically equivalent to the square root of something called the \"variance\", which is another measurement of the spread of some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the standard deviation, we can figure out how likely some points are to be different from the \"center\" of the data. We use it to learn if some results we got are \"weird\" or \"unexpected\" or if they fall within the normal range of what we should expect given how widely \"dispersed\" the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do you calculate the Standard Deviation for some data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The general formula for Standard Deviation is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above should be read: \"the standard deviation $\\sigma$ is equal to the square root of the sum of the squared distance between all data points and the average point.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Say what? \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain it step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean of the data\n",
    "2. Then for each datapoint: subtract the mean and square the result\n",
    "3. Then find the average of these squared squared differences.\n",
    "4. Take the square root of that and that is the standard deviation!\n",
    "\n",
    "### But what is it good for?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll let Wikipedia explain at the following [link](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the average (mean) ... A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are very close to the average. A high standard deviation means that the numbers are spread out.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> [In doing data analysis] ... scientists commonly report the standard deviation of numbers from the average number in experiments. They often decide that only differences bigger than two or three times the standard deviation are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying the above equation: The standard deviation for the average \n",
    "\n",
    "So the above equation is the standard deviation of a set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the standard deviation for the *average* of a set of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well you'd expect there to be some variability in some data if it was a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Do you think there'd be more or less variability in the *average* of this set of data? E.g., if you were to take a bunch of samples, and find the average, do you think there would be a higher or lower variability in this average than in the original set of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the above question before you scroll down for the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is **lower**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is that?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just think about it. What has more variance: the heights of people living in a city, or the *average height of people* between cities?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously there may be very wide differences within a city (e.g., some people are very short, others are very tall and the differences between them may be large.) But once you find the average of a city and compare it against averages of other cities, these averages should be much closer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you take the average of a bunch of data, you are \"doing away\" with a lot of the variance inherent in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the Standard Deviation $\\sigma$ of the *average* of some data is scaled down by a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$. As a result the eventual equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_{avg} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another twist: standard Deviation when you're dealing with proportions rather than typical numbers.\n",
    "The equation I gave above is the general Standard Deviation formula. But there's a more specific formula we'll be using in this notebook that better applies to our example of figuring proportions of something. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of measuring the proportion of a population that has some quality (e.g., \"the proportion of a group of students who want more I-Lab classes.\"), the equation for the standard deviation can be simplified to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_{avg} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p * (1-p)}{N}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "What do all these symbols mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll break them down one-by-one. Let's start with the left-hand side:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_{avg} = $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The left-hand side of the equation says the Standard Deviation of the proportion, also known as $\\sigma_{avg}$, is equal to the right side:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{p * (1-p)}{N}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $N$ is the total number of points in the \"population\" (e.g., the total number of students at Nueva)\n",
    "* $p$ is the true proportion of the population we're trying to measure (e.g., the proportion of students that would take more I-Lab classes if they were offered)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we don't know the true $p$ value. We are trying to estimate it by taking a sample of $n$ students (where $n \\lt N$, in other words we sample $n$ students that are only a subset of all possible $N$ students). \n"

    "\n",
    "Since we don't know the true value of $p$, we try to estimate it by taking a sample of $n$ students and asking them the question instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever proportion of students in our sample answer the question *(Yes/No) If we offered more Nueva classes, would you be open to taking it?* will be our **estimate for the value of $p$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will denote the estimate of $p$ as $\\hat{p}$, where the little funny symbol on top of the $p$ is called a `hat`.\n",

    "So $\\hat{p}$ is pronounced \"p-hat\".\n",

    "\n",
    "After all, if we knew that the Standard Deviation $\\sigma$ was really high (say, $25\\%$), then we can't really trust this survey because our data may be really dispersed. Getting a score of $26.6\\%$ isn't very reliable with a $\\sigma$ of $25\\%$ because it means there's also a good chance the $1.6\\%$ (calculated by $26.6\\% - 25\\%$) or even $51.6\\%$ of students want the I-Lab courses.\n",

    "In order to know it, the formula for Standard Deviation uses the value $p$. But the value of $p$ is *true* proportion of students who would answer \"Yes\" in our survey. And we don't know this number. That's why we're doing a survey in the first place! It takes too long to ask each and every student so we have to estimate $p$ with our best guess from a smaller sample.\n",

    "We plug $\\hat{p}$ for $p$ in our original equation to get an estimate for $\\sigma$.\n",

    "**Hypothesis Testing Summary**\n",
    "1. You set up a hypothesis test by having a `null hypothesis` called $h_0$ and an `alternative hypothesis` called $h_1$\n",
    "2. To figure out which is more likely to be true, you collect some data.\n",
    "3. You then take your data and compute some measurements (e.g., taking the average).\n",
    "4. Then with the data, you determine some `alpha` level. This is similar to the idea of your `risk tolerance` level. The `alpha` level is between `0` and `1` and refers to the *probability that you would have collected the data IF $h_0$ were true.*\n",
    "    * Many people, when conducting hypothesis testing, set their alpha to be 0.05. That means that there should only be a 5% change of the data appearing if it were $h_0$ that was true.\n",
    "5. You look at your measurement and calculate what percentage of time this measurement THIS EXTREME OR MORE SO would have come up. You can do this mathematically or by simulating it using a computer. For example, you can resample your data thousands of times and calculate how often you get measurements as extreme as the one you first did.\n",
    "6. If you get the measurement a very small fraction of times, smaller than your `alpha` level, then you say \"since there's only `alpha`% of times that this data would have yielded this measurement under the null hypothesis $h_0$, I'm going to reject it in favor of my alternative.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's the relationship between Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis testing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians say that the measurements you got, if they show up less than `alpha`% of the time, is *statistically significant.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "So what is the relationship between a `confidence level` (say, $0.95$) and an `alpha` level (say, $0.05$)? How does that play into whether the result is *statistically significant* or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a deep connectedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn about it, read over this link (especially the last section) and answer the question below: [click here](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/understanding-hypothesis-tests-confidence-intervals-and-confidence-levels).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 11:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your own words, what is the relationship between a `X% confidence interval` of an estimate and the `alpha` level?\n",
    " \n",
    "2. If I do a hypothesis test, and I sample some data and take a measurement to construct a 95% confidence interval of `(55, 95)` for some parameter called $\\mu$, what values does my estimate for $\\mu$ need to be in order for me to REJECT the null hypothesis at an alpha of `0.05`?"
