    "Based on your simulation, the probability of the suspicious data happening if the coin was really fair should be some small percentage. \n",

    "Let's call it `X`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also come up with another idea called our `risk tolerance`. It should be a number between `0` and `1`. The idea behind the `risk tolerance` is that if `X` falls beneath our risk tolerance threshold, we are comfortable claiming that the coin is rigged.\n",

    "Call this `risk tolerance` threshold `alpha`. (The Greek letter `alpha` is $\\alpha$.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Else, we say that we don't have sufficient evidence to claim that the coin is rigged.\n",

    "The \"threshold\" that our data needs to be that we pick to say that the game is rigged is known in statistics as `alpha`. (It's also known as the `critical value`). You can think of it as our \"bar for rejecting Hypothesis 1\". If our chance of the observed data showing up under Hypothesis 1 is lower than the `alpha`, then we will say that \"the data leads us to believe that Hypothesis 1 is false.\"\n",
